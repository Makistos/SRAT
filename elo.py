    @return Change in rating

    This function calculates the change in the rating using the world football
    ELO rating. The formula is:

    R = KG * (W - We)

    Where G is goal difference. If the game was won with one goal or less this is not adjusted.
    For two goal difference it is 3/2 and if it's greater than two, (11+N)/8 where N is goal difference.

    K is 20 which is the same as the coefficient in friendly international matches. Adjusting this will make
    changes bigger or smaller.

    W is the result, win = 1, draw = 0,5, loss = 0.

    We is expected result, calculated with

    We = 1 / (10^(-dr/400)+1)

    Where dr is the difference in rating. 100 is added if this was a home match.
